    <title>Automatically Deployed ABI Migrations</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Handling application binary interface (ABI) migrations has always been a hassle for Conda-Forge.
Maintaining ABI consistency helps enable the “just use conda-forge” experience for many of our users,
making certain that numpy’s blas is the same as scipy’s.
As libraries update their code, the new versions may be ABI incompatible, as function signatures and other symbols
may have changed, leading to the dreaded &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SegmentationFault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and other errors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conda-Forge Operational Risk</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been thinking about operational risk (op. risk).
Operational risks arise from failures of processes, for instance a missing email, or an automated software system not running properly.
Many commercial institutions are interested in minimizing op. risk, since it is risk that produces no value, as opposed to risks associated with investing.
This is also something I think about in my job at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lab49.com/"&gt;Lab49&lt;/a&gt;, where I’m a software engineering consultant focusing on financial institutions.
I think there is also a good analogy for Conda-Forge, even though we are not a commercial outfit.
In this case the risk we incur isn’t the potential for lost earnings but frustration for our users and maintainers in the form of bugs and lackluster user experience.
In this post I explore three main sources of operational risk for Conda-Forge: Automation, Top-Down Control, and Self-Service Structure.&lt;/p&gt;
